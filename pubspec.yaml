  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icon/
    - assets/icon/ai/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NEU
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeuBold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeueMed.ttf
          weight: 500

    - family: Kredit
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/kredit_back.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/kredit_back.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/kredit_back.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/kredit_back.ttf
          weight: 300

fonts:
  - family: Satoshi

      - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue.ttf
        weight: 400
      - asset: assets/fonts/Satoshi-Light.otf
        weight: 300
      - asset: assets/fonts/Satoshi-Italic.otf
        style: italic

    fonts:
